Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover without special treatment

It is an Android application that contains information about the Covid19 Virus. It contains detailed information about all countries.
Daily case numbers, death numbers can be learned. I code the project in Java language. Retrofit, Picasso technologies are used.<br>
